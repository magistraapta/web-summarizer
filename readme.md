# Text Summarization using Pre-Trained Model

## Pre-Trained Model
A pre-trained model is a machine learning
model that has been trained on a large
dataset and is designed to solve a specific task or
set of tasks before being reused or fine-tuned for a 
related task. These models are a significant component 
of modern AI and machine learning because they 
allow developers to leverage existing knowledge 
embedded in the model without having to start from scratch.
